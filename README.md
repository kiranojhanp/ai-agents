# Vertical AI Agents

This repository explores the potential of integrating large language models (LLMs) with various products to create vertical AI agents. These agents are designed to perform specific tasks within a particular industry or domain, leveraging the power of AI to automate processes, enhance decision-making, and improve overall efficiency.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kiranojhanp/ai-agents.git

```bash
cd <folder-name>
just install
```

3. Set up API Keys:
   Create API keys for the LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face, Ollama) and configure them in the appropriate settings file.

## Running the Project

Once you've set up the environment, you can run the project by going inside each folder and executing the `main.py` script. Refer to the specific instructions within the project for detailed usage guidelines.
